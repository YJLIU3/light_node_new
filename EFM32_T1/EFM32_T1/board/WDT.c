 * @brief  Main function
 * Main is called from __iar_program_start, see assembly startup file
 *
 * The purpose of this example is to demonstrate some basic functionality of the
 * WDOG, and while doing so write feedback to the LCD to make it easier to follow.
 * After initialization and corresponding enabling of the WDOG, the program
 * enters a loop where feedback is written to the LCD, while the WDOG timer is
 * cleared timely. When this is done some time, the system intentionally enters
 * a stalemate, and stops clearing the WDOG. The WDOG then generates a system
 * reset. The cause of the last reset is detected during initialization, and
 * the system now enters a stalemate without enabling the WDOG. When running
 * debug, the debugger is not able to keep track when the WDOG resets the system.
 * This will cause undefined behavior of the debug session.
 *
